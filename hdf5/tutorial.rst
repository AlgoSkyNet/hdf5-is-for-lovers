The SciPy Conference always kicks off with two days of tutorials. These sessions provide extremely affordable access to expert training, and consistently receive fantastic feedback from participants.

We are now accepting tutorial proposals from individuals or teams that would like to present a tutorial at SciPy 2012.

Whether you are a major contributor to a scientific Python library or an expert-level user, this is a great opportunity to share your knowledge and defray the costs of your SciPy 2012 registration.

Topics
Tutorials should be focused on covering a well-defined topic in a hands-on manner. We want to see attendees coding! Each tutoria techniques or packages, helping new or advanced python programmers develop better or faster scientific applicatking for awesome techniques or packages, helping new or advanced python programmers develop better or faster scientific applicatking for awesome techniques or packages, helping new or advanced python programmers develop better or faster scientific applications.

Stipend
In recognition of the effort required to plan and prepare a high quality tutorial, we give a $1,000 stipend to each instructor (or team of instructors) for each half-day session they lead.

Proposal submission
Jonathan Rocher, scientific software developer at Enthought, is the 2012 Tutorial Chair, and Dharhas Pothina, scientist at the Texas Water Development Board, is the vice-chair. To submit your tutorial proposal, please send the following materials to 2012Tutorials@scipy.org:

A short bio of the presenter or team members, containing a description of past experiences as a trainer/teacher/speaker, and (ideally) links to videos of these experiences if available.
An instruction indicating whether the tutorial should be in the Introductory or Advanced Track.
A (~15 lines) description of the tutorial, suitable for posting on the SciPy website for attendees to view. It should include the target audience, and expected level of knowledge prior to the class.
A more detailed outline of the tutorial content, including the duration of each part, and exercise sessions for the review process.
A list of Python packages that attendees will need to have installed prior to the class to follow along. Please mention if any packages are not cross platform. Installation instructions or links to installation documentation should be provided for packages that are not available through easy_install, pip, EPD, etc., or that require third party libraries.
If available, the tutorial notes, slides, exercise files, ipython notebooks, that you already have, even if they are preliminary.
